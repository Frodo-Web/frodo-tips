# Manticore
Manticore Search is a high-performance, open-source search engine designed to offer fast and precise full-text searches, along with other search-related functionalities. It originated as a fork of the Sphinx Search engine and has evolved to include features like full-text search, real-time indexing, and support for various data sources such as MySQL, PostgreSQL, ODBC, and CSV files. Manticore Search is known for its cost-efficiency, scalability, and SQL-like query language, making it a viable alternative to other search engines like Elasticsearch. It also supports advanced features such as replication, load balancing, and data backup, catering to the needs of modern, data-driven applicationsâ€‹.
## Terms
#### Percolate
In Manticore Search, the concept of "percolate" is used in a somewhat different context compared to traditional search operations.
#### Percolate Queries
Percolate queries, in the context of Manticore Search, refer to a kind of reverse search operation. Instead of the usual search process where you have a query and you look for documents that match this query, with percolate queries, you have a document, and you look for queries that match this document. This is useful in scenarios where you want to alert or trigger actions based on incoming documents that match certain predefined criteria or queries.
#### Percolate Table
A percolate table in Manticore Search is a special type of table designed to store these percolate queries. Just like a regular table stores data records, a percolate table stores queries that are used for matching against incoming documents. When a new document comes in, it can be "percolated" through this table to find any stored queries that the document matches. It is used for prospective searches, or "search in reverse." 
#### Percolate Table Schemas
The schema of a percolate table in Manticore Search defines the structure and format of the queries that can be stored within it. This includes the types of fields that queries can match against, the types of matching or querying operations that can be used (like match phrases, boolean operations, etc.), and potentially other metadata related to the queries. The schema helps ensure that the percolate table is organized and can efficiently handle the percolation process for incoming documents.

In essence, percolate functionality in Manticore Search allows for a dynamic and inverted approach to searching, where the documents become the input for queries stored within a specialized table, enabling a wide range of use cases such as real-time monitoring, alerting, and filtering of incoming data streams based on complex criteria.

```sql
CREATE TABLE products(title text, meta json) type='pq';
```

#### Real-Time (RT) table
In Manticore Search, a "real-time" (RT) table is a type of table that allows for on-the-fly data indexing without the need for a predefined data source or a delayed indexing process. Real-time tables are designed to support immediate data ingestion, enabling you to add, update, or delete documents in the index instantly, making the changes searchable right away. This is in contrast to traditional indexing methods that require batch processing of data and rebuilding of the index to reflect new or updated content.

A Real-time table is a main type of table in Manticore, allowing you to add, update, and delete documents with immediate availability of the changes. The settings for a Real-time Table can be defined in a configuration file or online using CREATE/UPDATE/DELETE/ALTER commands.

##### Chunks
A Real-time Table is comprised of one or multiple plain tables called chunks. There are two types of chunks:
- multiple disk chunks - These are stored on disk and have the same structure as a Plain Table.
- single ram chunk - This is stored in memory and is used as an accumulator of changes.

The size of the RAM chunk is controlled by the rt_mem_limit setting. Once this limit is reached, the RAM chunk is flushed to disk in the form of a disk chunk. If there are too many disk chunks, they can be merged into one for better performance using the OPTIMIZE command or automatically.

##### Features
Real-time tables support various features, including:
- Dynamic indexing. You can insert, update, or delete documents in real time, making them immediately searchable.
- Flexible schema. The schema of an RT table, which defines the structure of the indexed data, can include various field types and attributes, similar to what you might define in a traditional database table.
- Full-text search capabilities. RT tables support Manticore Search's full-text search features, allowing for complex querying and searching within the indexed data.
- Attributes for filtering and sorting. Besides the full-text fields, RT tables can include attributes (such as integers, timestamps, strings, etc.) that can be used for filtering, sorting, and grouping search results.
- Transaction support. Changes to RT tables can be done within transactions, providing atomicity for batches of operations.

Real-time tables are particularly useful in scenarios where the dataset is dynamic, and the application requires the search index to be updated in real-time as the underlying data changes. This makes RT tables suitable for applications such as live dashboards, real-time analytics, and any other use case where immediate searchability of fresh data is critical.

```sql
CREATE TABLE products(title text, price float) morphology='stem_en';
```

#### Plain table
Plain table is a basic element for non-percolate searching. It can be defined only in a configuration file using the Plain mode, and is not supported in the RT mode. It is typically used in conjunction with a source to process data from the external storage and can later be attached to a real-time table.

Plain table is a mostly immutable data structure and a basic element used by real-time tables. Plain table stores a set of documents, their common dictionary and indexation settings. One real-time table can consist of multiple plain tables (chunks), but besides that Manticore provides direct access to building plain tables using tool indexer. It makes sense when your data is mostly immutable, therefore you don't need a real-time table for that.

Here's an example of a plain table configuration and a source for fetching data from a MySQL database:
```
source source {
  type             = mysql
  sql_host         = localhost
  sql_user         = myuser
  sql_pass         = mypass
  sql_db           = mydb
  sql_query        = SELECT id, title, description, category_id  from mytable
  sql_attr_uint    = category_id
  sql_field_string = title
 }

table tbl {
  type   = plain
  source = source
  path   = /path/to/table
 }
```
#### Real-time mode vs plain mode

Manticore Search works in two modes:

- Real-time mode (RT mode). This is a default one and allows to manage your data schema imperatively:

        allows managing your data schema online using SQL commands CREATE/ALTER/DROP TABLE and their equivalents in non-SQL clients
  
        in the configuration file you need to define only server-related settings including data_dir
  
- Plain mode allows to define your data schemas in a configuration file, i.e. provides declarative kind of schema management. It makes sense in three cases:

        when you only deal with plain tables
  
        or when your data schema is very stable and you don't need replication (as it's available only in the RT mode)
  
        when you have to make your data schema portable (e.g. for easier deployment of it on a new server)

### Overview

By default Manticore is waiting for your connections on:
- port 9306 for MySQL clients
- port 9308 for HTTP/HTTPS connections
- port 9312 for connections from other Manticore nodes and clients based on Manticore binary API

Connect to Manticore
```
mysql -h0 -P9306
```

Let's now create a table called "products" with 2 fields and add few documents to the table:
```sql
create table products(title text, price float) morphology='stem_en';
insert into products(title,price) values ('Crossbody Bag with Tassel', 19.85), ('microfiber sheet set', 19.99), ('Pet Hair Remover Glove', 7.99);
```
Note that it is possible to omit creating a table with an explicit create statement. For more information, see Auto schema.

Let's find one of the documents. The query we will use is 'remove hair'. As you can see, it finds a document with the title 'Pet Hair Remover Glove' and highlights 'Hair remover' in it, even though the query has "remove", not "remover". This is because when we created the table, we turned on using English stemming (morphology "stem_en").
```sql
select id, highlight(), price from products where match('remove hair');
..


+---------------------+-------------------------------+----------+
| id                  | highlight()                   | price    |
+---------------------+-------------------------------+----------+
| 1513686608316989452 | Pet <strong>Hair Remover</strong> Glove | 7.990000 |
+---------------------+-------------------------------+----------+
1 row in set (0.00 sec)
```

Let's assume we now want to update the document - change the price to 18.5. This can be done by filtering by any field, but normally you know the document id and update something based on that.
Let's now delete all documents with price lower than 10.
```sql
update products set price=18.5 where id = 1513686608316989452;
delete from products where price < 10;
```
